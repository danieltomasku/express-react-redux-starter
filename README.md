# Express - React - Redux Starter Pack
Skeleton for website using ExpressJS, isomorphic ReactJS w/ React Router and Flux w/ Redux. Bunndling with Gulp.

## Install
 - Install package `npm i`
 - Run dev server with `gulp`


## Notes
 - Using [imagemin-pngquant](https://www.npmjs.com/package/imagemin-pngquant)@4.2.2 because version 5.0.0 was causing gulp errors
 - Manually cloned [react-ga](https://github.com/react-ga/react-ga) from github because the published version on npm did not include the timing function.
